# Programming road â€” Programming Learning and Growth Record

Welcome to Programming road, a repository for recording personal programming learning and growth. Through this repository, I will share the challenges I encountered, the problems I solved, the technical explorations, and self-reflection in the process of learning programming.

## Main Content

This repository mainly includes the following parts:

- Programming questions and answers: The source code of the questions I practiced on major online platforms (such as Luogu, Blue Bridge Cup, Niuke, etc.). The link to each question will be attached for your reference and discussion.

- Learning records and summaries: In addition to practicing questions, I will also record my gains and thoughts in learning data structures, algorithms, C++ and other technologies, and share some notes and tutorials I have compiled.

- Personal growth and reflection: Not only the improvement of technology, I will also share my mental journey, learning insights and goal setting in the warehouse. You can see how I gradually grew from zero foundation to a programming enthusiast.

### Question link format

For your convenience, all programming question links will be attached in the following format:

Luogu question link:
``` url
https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/ + <question number>
```
For example:
``` url
https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P11041
```
Niuke question link:
Each Niuke question will also be attached with a direct link.

## How to contribute

All programming enthusiasts are welcome to communicate with me, point out code problems, and make suggestions for improvement. You can participate in the following ways:

- Issues: Discuss issues, make suggestions or conduct technical exchanges in the Issues section of the repository.

- Pull Requests: If you find that there are areas that need improvement in the code or documents, you are welcome to submit Pull Requests. I will carefully review and refer to your changes.

## Goals and expectations

My goal is to record my learning process through this repository and share the experience with more people. I hope to make continuous progress through interaction with everyone and help more students who are learning programming find the right learning methods and solutions.

## Updates and Maintenance
This repository will be updated regularly and the content will continue to be enriched. Although there is no fixed schedule for updates, I will try my best to stay active and submit my programming problem solutions, study notes, and other useful resources as I please.
